<h2>Help for Students</h2>

Welcome to this exercizing platform, it is designed just for you!


<h4>General principle of the platform</h4>

<p>To be able to practice, you must first register for a <b>session</b> 
(attention, each session has a start date and an end date, outside which exercises are not available).
</p>

<p>Each <b>session</b> offers an ordered list of <b>exercises</b>. The first exercise is available as soon as the session opens.
Other exercises may also be available straight away or only a few days later (in the case of a <i>timed</i>) session or 
when you reach a certain score to the previous exercise. </p>

<p>There are <b>skills</b> associated with each exercise. 
These are not yet visible put will be in some time 
(missing features - <i> help wanted!</i>).

<h4>Solving an exercise</h4>

<p>All exercices work in the same way:
    <ol>
      <li>they display a statement containing instructions and an archive file of <code>.tar.gz</code> type to download;</li>
      <li>You download the archive and puts it on a Unix system [<a href='#acces_a_un_Unix'>1</a>] ;</li> 
      <li>you extract the content of the archive on this system and work with it, guided by the questions in the statement;</li>
      <li>you in turn create an archive containing the result of your work;</li>
      <li>you put this archive on the exercise page, which analyzes it and tells you what's correct or not in your answers.  
            You also get a score (overall success percentage) for this attempt.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>        

<p>A <i>Hints</i> section is usually present below the questions, in case you're having a hard time solving the exercise.
     But try first to not look at it: you will progress more sustainably. 
     Finding a solution is a very important part of the learning process, don't spoil yourself ;-)
</p>

<p>You can try again solving an exercise as many times as you want (without having to leave the exercise page), 
    as long as the exercise is available.</p>
<p>The system records your score for each attempt. If the session you are participating in is organized by a teacher, 
    do not hesitate to ask if he/she only accounts your last attempt, or your best attempt ;-)</p>

        <p>[1] Where to solve an exercise? 
            <ul>
                <li>on your machine from a terminal: if you have a <code>Linux</code>, 
                    <code>FreeBSD</code> or <code>MacOS</code> operating system
                    then you have a Unix-like system!  If you have <code>Windows</code>, 
                    it offers you to install Unix (<i>Ubuntu</i>) 
                    directly as a subsystem inside <code>Windows</code>.</li>
                <li>on a website from your browser: several sites provide you 
                    with free access to Unix (real or emulated) systems that allows files 
                    to be uploaded and downloaded 
                    (e.g., <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a>,  
                    <a href="https://cocalc.com/" target="_blank">CoCalc</a>, ...). 
                    This is a little less comfortable but it allows you to work directly 
                    from your internet browser.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
